 娘以指叩门扉曰：‘儿寒乎？欲食乎？’吾从板外相为应答。”语未毕，余泣，妪亦泣。
 一日，大母过余曰：”吾儿，久不见若影，何竟日默默在此，大类女郎也？”比去，以手阖门，自语曰：”吾家读书久不效，儿之成，则可待乎！”顷之，持一象笏至，曰：”此吾祖太常公宣德间执此以朝，他日汝当用之！”瞻顾遗迹，如在昨日，令人长号不自禁。

 年少读书，只知将这些晦涩的文字记于心中，难以体会文字背后的辛酸与追忆。如今，大概是多了些经历吧！再看到“庭有枇杷树，吾妻死之年所手植也，今已亭亭如盖矣。”这样的句子，难免被它带到了回忆中去了.....
 记得当时最头痛的事就是写读后感了，只觉一遍读完，除了不懂好像没了其它的感了。尽管如何，还是要硬着头皮写上个六百字，现在想起，还不由得会佩服当时的自己......
